As a researcher with over three years of experience, my work spans the engineering of large-scale distributed systems, including swarm robotics and smart cities, and extends into pioneering the field of many-agent reinforcement learning. My passion for teaching has led me to design and deliver courses on advanced programming paradigms and distributed systems. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in the Scala open-source community, where I have over five years of contributions. I maintain the \href{http://scafi.github.io/}{\url{ScaFi}} library, instrumental in our research, and contribute to the \href{http://alchemistsimulator.github.io/}{\url{Alchemist}} project, a simulator for pervasive systems.
